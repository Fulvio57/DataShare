### Files to make Geany highlighter for [Positron Basic Compile](https://protoncompiler.com/)
_Currently there's little to have the complete highlight_

The herein files should be placed in

```bash
$HOME/.config/geany/filedefs/filetypes.PBasic.conf
```
and
```bash
$HOME/.config/geany/filetype_extensions.conf.
```

**Note:** the file extension of the sources is *.**Bas**, in order that Geany will recognize the file.
